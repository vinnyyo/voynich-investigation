## Investigations into this mysterious book

This is an investigation into a mysterious 600 year old book that has never been decoded. The book is written in an unknown language and has paintings of plants that don't exist. Science's best explanation is that a ufo accidentally dropped the book on the way to the next planet.

With further research, we may one day be able to speak with the space people, in their native language. Though it seems as though the book is [just written in turkish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6keMgLmFEk).
